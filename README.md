# Contact Management System

## 📚 Project Description

This is a **Java Swing application** developed as part of a **university project**. The application demonstrates the implementation of the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern in a basic contact management system.

The Contact Management System allows users to:

- Add a new contact with a first name, last name, and city.
- Enter multiple phone numbers in a table (region code and phone number).
- Save or cancel the form submission.
- View structured GUI layout using Java Swing components.

The GUI was built with a clean, modular structure, and includes a table that highlights the last row in gray as a visual cue (acting like a footer).

## 📂 Project Structure

This project follows the **MVC pattern** and is organized as:

- `model/` - Business logic and data structures.
- `view/` - GUI components (e.g., `AddContactView.java`).
- `controller/` - Event handling and control flow.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Java Swing for GUI
- MVC Design Pattern
